The problem of inducing general functions from specific training examples is central to concept learning.
It can be formulated as a problem of searching through predefined space of potential hypothesis for the hypothesis that fits the training example.
Algorithms-
1. Find S
2. Candidate Elimination Algorithm.
Most specific string - NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
